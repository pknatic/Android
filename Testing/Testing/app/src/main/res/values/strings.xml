    <string name="content">Keywords and functions are different components in programming languages:

Keywords: Keywords are reserved words in a programming language that have predefined meanings and are used for specific purposes. These words cannot be used as variable names or identifiers because they are already assigned a specific meaning by the language. Examples of keywords in C include if, else, while, int, float, return, and so on. Keywords are part of the language syntax and are used to define control structures, data types, and other language-specific constructs.

Functions: Functions, on the other hand, are blocks of code that perform a specific task or operation. They are reusable code segments that can be called from different parts of a program. Functions encapsulate a series of instructions and often accept input parameters and produce output results. They allow for code modularity, organization, and reusability. In C, functions are typically defined with a return type, a name, a set of parameters (optional), and a function body that contains the code to be executed when the function is called.

In summary, keywords are predefined reserved words in a programming language with specific meanings, while functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task and are called from different parts of a program. Keywords are part of the languages syntax, while functions are reusable code segments that can be defined and called by the programmer.
    In C, float and double are both floating-point data types used to represent real numbers with decimal points. However, they differ in terms of precision and storage size:

Precision: float is a single-precision floating-point type that typically occupies 4 bytes of memory. It provides approximately 6 decimal digits of precision. On the other hand, double is a double-precision floating-point type that typically occupies 8 bytes of memory. It offers significantly higher precision, providing around 15 decimal digits.

Range: Due to its larger size, double can represent a wider range of values compared to float. float can handle numbers ranging from approximately 1.2 x 10^(-38) to 3.4 x 10^38, while double can represent values from approximately 2.2 x 10^(-308) to 1.8 x 10^308.

Memory Usage: As mentioned earlier, float occupies 4 bytes of memory, while double occupies 8 bytes. This means that double requires more memory to store its values compared to float.

When choosing between float and double, consider the required precision and the range of values your program needs to handle. If you need higher precision or a broader range, double is typically a better choice. However, if memory usage is a concern or the required precision is relatively low, float can be more efficient.</string>
